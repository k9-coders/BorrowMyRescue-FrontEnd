                <h5>Dogs4Rescue is a unique, independent dog rescue and sanctuary in a semi-rural part of Manchester where the dogs live together in a kennel free environment.Â  The dogs spend their days getting all the exercise, socialisation, stimulation, love and care that they need whilst waiting for their forever homes.</h5>
                <h5>If you would like to have a dog without the commitment or expense of keeping them long-term, then why not consider borrowing a dog from us for just one day, a weekend or even a week with our Borrow My Rescue scheme. It is a great idea and very beneficial to the dogs. Why not have a special day out with a nice long walk? Or perhaps let one of our dogs join you for a relaxing weekend in a home with a garden? </h5>
                <h5>Perhaps are you interested in long term borrowing? We also welcome anyone who would like to offer one of our longer stayers a foster home.</h5>
                <h5>If you live in the Greater Manchester, please complete your details below and we will be in touch.</h5>
                <br></br>
                <h5>If you can't borrow a dog at the moment, or live outside of Greater Manchester, but would like to support us then why not join our Golden Paw Club, Sponsor one of our Sanctuary Dogs, donate to our Pawket Money Toys Fund or follow us on FaceBook?</h5>
